# vantage-point
This program utilizes the AlphaVantage API to acquire real time data on stock price, volume and simple moving average. 

The data is then displayed using the matplotlib library. 

This is all integrated in a simple Tkinter GUI to get user input on the interval of data displayed as well as the stock symbol.
